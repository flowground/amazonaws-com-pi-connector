The guide\nprovides detailed information about Performance Insights data types, parameters\nand errors. For more information about Performance Insights capabilities see \nUsing Amazon RDS Performance Insights\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.html] \nin the Amazon RDS User Guide.\n\n The AWS Performance Insights API provides visibility into the performance of\nyour RDS instance, when Performance Insights is enabled for supported engine\ntypes. While Amazon CloudWatch provides the authoritative source for AWS service\nvended monitoring metrics, AWS Performance Insights offers a domain-specific\nview of database load measured as Average Active Sessions and provided to API\nconsumers as a 2-dimensional time-series dataset. The time dimension of the data\nprovides DB load data for each time point in the queried time range, and each\ntime point decomposes overall load in relation to the requested dimensions, such\nas SQL, Wait-event, User or Host, measured at that time point.",
